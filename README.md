# pptx_lib

This is a collection of function to be used together with the python pptx libraries. The idea is to simplify common actions such as locating textboxes and other objects, moving  and deleting slides, merging cells and creating tables using Pandas Dataframes. 

The following functions are included, each one is documented inside the code:

* delete_slide
* locate_paragraph
* locate_shape
* run_text
* bold_table_cell
* create_table
* mergeCellsHorizontally
* iter_cells
* move_slide
* inject_text

More functions are to be added as needed.
